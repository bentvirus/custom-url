<h1 align="center">what is a bent virus</h1>
<p align="center">A virus is a biological agent that reproduces inside the cells of living hosts. 
When infected by a virus, a host cell is forced to produce many thousands of identical 
copies of the original virus at an extraordinary rate. Unlike most living things, viruses 
do not have cells that divide; new viruses are assembled in the infected host cell. But 
unlike still simpler infectious agents, viruses contain genes, which gives them the 
ability to mutate and evolve. Over 5,000 species of viruses have been discovered</p>
